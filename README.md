# Bypassed-Virage-Macro
I just bypass virage macro for fun even though I don't play grow a garden anymore

I know making this stuff will make Virage Developers make the security even harder but they just add code and code is really easy to remove

Even though this looks sus I'm more dumb than a normal person so I dont even know how to put malware on this stuff, like getting malware from script/code looks pretty hard to make, I'm not onto that stuff. I don't even code, I just remove codes to get stuff for free ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘


if you dont trust me just remove


function1(username) {
    global GAME_PASS_ID
